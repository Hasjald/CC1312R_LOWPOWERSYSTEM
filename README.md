/* micreedlight node as the node for the system, use LAUNCHXL-CC1312R launchpad from TI along with an ULP-SENSOR Boosterpack. There is currently a bug where the adc and light sensor values become 0 after sending 1 packet from the node to the gateway. 
   for the wakeonreedgatewayfinal as the gateway, another Launchpad LAUNCHXL-CC1312R is needed for this. DIO 1 is uart TX on the Gateway.
